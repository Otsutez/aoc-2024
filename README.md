# Advent of Code 2024

This is my solution to Advent of Code 2024 🎄 in Rust 🦀.

Each day's solution is it's own binary target.
To run the solution, create an `input` directory in the project root and put 
input files there. Each day's input shoud be named `dayX` where `X` is the 
day's number. Because I wanted to mess around with conditional compilation,
part 1 is run by enabling the `part1` feature
```
cargo run --bin day1 --features part1
```
and part 2 by enabling the `part2` feature
```
cargo run --bin day1 --features part2
```
